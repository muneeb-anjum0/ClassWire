# Operations and Reliability

ClassWire runs a static React client on Vercel and a Flask API on Render. Firestore provides durable per-user storage, Gmail remains the authoritative timetable source, and GitHub Actions handles scheduled delivery and continuous verification.

## Deployment topology

| Service | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Vercel | Static frontend, public metadata, route delivery, and production environment configuration |
| Render | Flask and Gunicorn API, OAuth callbacks, search, ingestion, and metrics |
| Cloud Firestore | Encrypted token records, settings, timetable documents, and normalized source documents |
| Gmail API | Read-only source discovery and message retrieval |
| GitHub Actions | Pull-request quality gates and scheduled daily delivery |

## Render process behavior

- Gunicorn binds `0.0.0.0` to the platform-provided `PORT`.
- The health route avoids Firestore and Gmail network calls.
- Heavy service initialization occurs only when a request needs the service.
- Startup and crash logs are sent to standard output.
- Threaded handling supports lightweight concurrent requests without multiplying cloud clients unnecessarily.
- Shared-memory worker temporary files avoid slower disk-backed heartbeat behavior.

The free Render instance can suspend after inactivity. Early frontend connection hints and a lightweight wake request reduce avoidable delay, but provider suspension can still make the first request substantially slower than warm traffic.

## Background delivery

Daily timetable email delivery does not rely on an untracked daemon thread inside the web process. A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow calls an authenticated synchronous automation endpoint and waits for a definitive success or failure response.

Workflow concurrency prevents overlapping runs. Temporary network failures receive bounded retries. This provides observable background execution without a paid cloud worker.

## Failure recovery

| Failure | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Gmail temporarily unavailable | Use the last persisted normalized source and label the answer stale |
| One Gmail batch component fails | Retry the failed component; reject unresolved partial weeks |
| Firestore source is stale | Decode once, retain it for fallback, and attempt refresh |
| Browser request fails | Preserve the last successful visible result |
| Older request completes late | Ignore it through request sequencing |
| Concurrent refresh arrives | Join the existing per-user refresh work |
| IndexedDB unavailable | Fall back without preventing search or display |
| Oversized compressed document | Reject before attempting an unsafe Firestore write |

## Request observability

Every API response carries:

- an `X-Request-ID` for correlation;
- a `Server-Timing` duration visible in browser developer tools.

Non-health API requests emit structured JSON logs containing route template, method, status, duration, request ID, and response size. User queries, timetable rows, Gmail bodies, OAuth material, and faculty or course contents are excluded.

## Runtime metrics

The dependency-free in-process registry tracks:

- response count by route and status;
- average and p95 route latency;
- parser duration and accepted or rejected row counts;
- search interpretation and matching duration;
- matched-row volume;
- Gmail messages fetched;
- source tier: memory, Firestore, Gmail, or stale fallback;
- Firestore reads, writes, and deleted account documents;
- token, settings, timetable, source, and repeated-query cache hits.

A secret-protected endpoint exposes snapshots. Metrics reset when the Render process restarts, so they are diagnostic runtime counters rather than durable historical monitoring.

## Cost visibility

ClassWire does not claim access to a provider invoice. It counts the operations controlled by the application:

- normal searches use normalized rows and perform no Gmail read;
- repeated reads are absorbed by TTL caches;
- ordinary searches create no Firestore write;
- unchanged timetable and source writes are suppressed by hashes;
- only changed weekday messages are downloaded;
- browser restoration uses IndexedDB;
- one bootstrap request replaces multiple startup calls.

These measurements support cost estimation without a paid monitoring platform or fabricated billing figures.

## Security operations

- Repository checks reject tracked environment files, private keys, service-account files, common secret formats, unexpected root entries, and executable tracked files.
- Dependency audits run for Python and npm production dependencies.
- Backend tests run with branch-aware coverage.
- Frontend behavior tests, coverage thresholds, TypeScript validation, and the production build run in CI.
- Production configuration refuses weak or missing secrets.
- Account deletion removes every owned application document and clears caches.

## Current boundaries

- Free-tier cold starts remain controlled by Render.
- In-process telemetry is not durable across restarts.
- The Gmail parser is deterministic and versioned, but a future timetable format can still require a parser update.
- Progressive rendering is appropriate for current timetable sizes; thousands of visible rows could justify viewport virtualization.
- Firestore TTL deletion is asynchronous after the application-provided expiry timestamp.
